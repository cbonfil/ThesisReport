A numerical method for a memristor simulation is developed and tested in previous chapters based on drift-diffusion equations and finite difference. This chapter introduces the memristor's structure and the physical parameters used for the simulation. It continues with a preliminary problem analysis to determine the required mesh density and maximum possible time step. This preliminary analysis is followed by 1-D simulations of a memristor under various conditions.


\section{Memristor Structure}
%-Problem Analysis and assumptions, semiconductor vs memristor plots

Following figure (\ref{MemStc}) shows the structure of a simple memristor which is taken as a basis for all the memristor simulations presented in this thesis. It consists of 2 metal contacts, a polymer conductor strip (PEDOT:PSS) and an electrolyte solution which has lithium and perchlorate ions (perchlorate/lithium density $\approx$ 6.02 $10^{23}$ $m^{-3}$). The memristor is about 1 cm long and 1 mm wide. The thickness of the conductive layer is around 1 $\mu$m. During the experiment, the electrolyte solution is deposited on PEDOT:PSS using a syringe so its thickness can vary drastically but as long as the amount of ions in the electrolyte solution is enough to saturate PEDOT:PSS this does not make a significant difference in the operation of the memristor. For simulation it was assumed that there are always more than enough ions to saturate the PEDOT:PSS so the electrolyte is modeled as an infinite source/sink of ions. The top boundary of the electrolyte is assumed to be charge neutral at all times which provides a mechanism for moving ions in and out of the system. This way the movement of ions near the surface of the PEDOT can still be captured without having to simulate the ion movement for the entire electrolyte solution which is variable in size.

\label{MemStc}
\end{figure}


The initial conditions for all the charge carriers are the same. Negative and positive charges are balanced and uniformly distributed. Perchlorate ions are not allowed to move outside the electrolyte solution so a no flow boundary condition is used around the electrolyte. Lithium ions are free to move between PEDOT:PSS and the electrolyte solution but their maximum concentration is limited inside the PEDOT:PSS. The mobility of the lithium ions has further restrictions inside PEDOT:PSS. Lithium ions have higher mobility in PEDOT:PSS under the electrolyte solution, referred as wet PEDOT:PSS, than the region without any contact with electrolyte, dry PEDOT:PSS. In fact due to this difference only a very little amount of lithium reaches the metal contacts. This decrease in the mobility was modeled by making the mobility of lithium a function of position in PEDOT:PSS. The mobility of lithium ions were assumed to be 100 times slower than the mobility of holes in the wet PEDOT:PSS and it is zero in the dry PEDOT:PSS( $\mu_{hole} \approx$ $10^{-3}$ $m^2/Vs$). 


PEDOT:PSS is a regular conductor with fixed negative charge and mobile holes. Holes can move in an out of the PEDOT:PSS through the metal contacts which preserve the charge neutrality of the initial condition throughout the simulation. The interface between PEDOT and electrolyte only allows the exchange of lithium ions. During the simulation,the movement of lithium ions changes the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS by increasing or decreasing the amount of available holes. In the actual memristor lithium ions also change the conductivity through additional physical effects like changing the mobility of holes by modifying their hopping distance. Even though the mobility of the holes can simply be made a function of the lithium density, the shape of this function is not known. The physical details of the additional effects are beyond the scope of this thesis.

\section{Simulation Requirements}

It is important to analyze the computational requirements of a simulation in order to asses the feasibility of the computational scheme. In this case, it is possible to determine the spacial and the temporal requirements using the equations \ref{debye} and \ref{CFL_Drift} which describe physical and numerical limitations of the simulation. Following graph \ref{SpaceTime} shows the requirements for a memristor of the scale discussed above and a typical semiconductor device size around 1 $\mu$m. The mesh density has to be high enough in order to capture the exponential charge accumulation for charge shielding so the minimum step size was set to be 5 times smaller than the Debye length. Plots \ref{SpaceTime}.a and \ref{SpaceTime}.c show the amount of points required to simulate a semiconductor and a memristor based on minimum step size. It is important to note that these values are for 1-D simulation and they can be converted to 2-D and 3-D by taking the square or the cube of the values in y axis respectively. Plots \ref{SpaceTime}.b and \ref{SpaceTime}.d are created using CFL conditions for drift and diffusion and dielectric relaxation time. A typical simulation time is estimated using the mobility and the electric field. Based on the estimated simulation time the number of time steps are calculated using the minimum time step obtained from CFL conditions and dielectric relaxation time.

It can be seen from graphs \ref{SpaceTime}.a and \ref{SpaceTime}.c that memristor simulations require much higher mesh densities compared to a typical semiconductor simulation such as 1 $\mu$m long PN diode. This is due to the larger size and higher charge density of the memristor. Plots \ref{SpaceTime}.a and \ref{SpaceTime}.b show that a memristor with $10^{26}$ $m^{-3}$ charge density requires close to $10^9$ points and $10^{14}$ time steps to simulate in 1-D. These requirements make the simulation of the memristor extremely challenging. In order to investigate and find possible solutions to this issue, first a memristor with low charge density ($\approx 10^{15}$) is simulated in order to ensure that the simulation functions as designed. Then memristors with different charge densities are simulated and compared to each other to asses whether the behavior at low charge densities will be comparable to the behavior at high charge densities.

\section{1-D Memristor Approximation}

The horizontal cross section from figure \ref{MemStc} has the most crucial elements of the memristor but its simulation in 1-D is not straight forward. This cross section through the PEDOT does not include the vertical movement of the lithium ions. Without this effect, PEDOT:PSS is just a regular conductor with a uniform current density. In order to overcome this problem a generation/recombination term for lithium ions (calculated at every time step) was added to capture the vertical movement in addition to the regular drift diffusion equations which represents the horizontal movement. This generation/recombination term can be symbolized as a current source with a resistor connected to all the nodes (figure \ref{MemStc15}). Perchlorate ions were not included in the simulation since they do not move into the PEDOT.

\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.74]{1DMem}
\caption{1.5-D Memristor Structure} 
\label{MemStc15}
\end{figure}

The lithium source has two different terms, one for drift and another one for diffusion. It was assumed that the concentration of lithium is always constant in the electrolyte. This way the vertical diffusion current density can be calculated using the difference between the lithium density in PEDOT and electrolyte. For the diffusion term an electric field is estimated between the PEDOT:PSS and the electrolyte. First the potential of the electrolyte is assumed to be half of the net applied potential. Then an electric field is calculated using the electrolyte and the instantaneous potential of the PEDOT at different positions.

Since the main characteristic of a memristor is the change in resistivity over time it is important to develop a standard approach for measuring the resistivity. Initially, simulations in this chapter and the following one, are run until steady state without the movement of lithium/perchlorate ions. Ions in the electrolyte start to move after holes reach steady state. The movement of ions create another transient which involves changes in resistivity. The current density (at steady state) obtained from the initial simulation is used as a normalizing factor in order to determine the changes in resistivity after the ion movement has started.

\section{1-D Memristor Simulations}

Following simulations are made based on the memristor approximations discussed above. The first two simulations are repeated in the next chapter using a 2-D drift diffusion and Poisson solver which captures a broader range of physical effects. Both approaches are compared in order to understand their advantages and disadvantages under different circumstances.

\subsection{1-D Memristor Simulation Using a Potential Pulse Train}
  
For the following simulation a potential pulse train, slow enough to let the memristor reach steady state, is applied at the left contact.
\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.40]{1DMemPulseTrain}
%\includegraphics[scale=0.60]{Ex5DCResistivity}
\caption{Change in resistivity over time due to applied potential} 
\label{MemResTrain}
\end{figure}
 Following plot \ref{MemResTrain} shows the resistivity measured using both contacts separately. As expected the resistance of the device more than doubled as the lithium ions move in. Additionally, it can be seen from the graph \ref{MemResTrain} that the resistivity measurements from left and right contacts are not always the same over the duration of the simulation. This is due to the PEDOT:PSS layer losing holes on one side and gaining holes on the other side which produces a difference in the measured resistivity between contacts. The scale of the difference depends on the rate of change in resistivity on either side. When holes are not fast enough to track the change in the ion movement, the current on each side can take different values.  

The resistivity in figure \ref{MemResTrain} shows a sudden drop when the potential is switched from 1 to 0 and vice versa. This sudden drop occurs because of the accumulation of lithium ions and holes near the negative contact which create an opposing potential to the applied potential (see figure \ref{MemEss}). When the potential changes suddenly, previously opposing electric field now helps the movement of holes and lithium towards the other end of the device. This additional electric field momentarily reduces the resistivity of the device.

\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.70]{1DMemPot_Efield_SS}
\caption{Potential and electric field at steady state} 
\label{MemEss}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{MempLi} demonstrates the replacement of holes by lithium ions over time which directly effects resistivity seen in figure \ref{MemResistivityTrain}.  As lithium ions get pulled in from the electrolyte toward the contact they accumulate inside the PEDOT:PSS and push holes out via coulomb forces. Decreased hole concentration in the PEDOT:PSS increases the resistivity of the material. This change in resistivity over time is illustrated in figure \ref{MemResTrain}.

\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{1DMemDensityOverTime}
%\includegraphics[scale=0.40]{Ex5pNp_Time1}
\caption{Lithium and hole density distribution over time} 
\label{MempLi}
\end{figure}

It is important to note that lithium ions are free to move in x and y direction. In figure \ref{MempLi} it can be seen that after the potential is switched as the lithium density moves from  side to the other. Most of the lithium movement happens through the exchange of ions between PEDOT and the electrolyte since the distance between them is far less than the length of the PEDOT. So most of the lithium ions, traveling from the positive to the negative contact, are pulled into the electrolyte before they reach the other side. Near the negative contact lithium ions are quickly pulled into the PEDOT:PSS and accumulate at the wet/dry interface. Figure \ref{MemResistivityTrain} shows the changes in resistivity throughout PEDOT due to the accumulation of lithium. The resistivity is increased in regions where there is high lithium accumulation. 

By examining the resistivity plot of the PEDOT:PSS it is possible to conclude that it is composed of 3 distinct regions. 2 dry regions, where there is no contact with the electrolyte, have constant uniform resistance. Between these two resistances there is a variable non uniformly distributed resistance controlled by hole/lithium concentration and hole mobility. So this model captures the main characteristic of the memristor which is a variable resistance where the resistance at any time depends on the past of the device. Following equation gives the total resistance/memristance for the memristor model developed for this thesis:

\begin{equation}
\centering
M(q(t))_{tot}=2R_{dry}+R(Li,p,\mu_{hole})
\end{equation}

The minimum resistance of this device is just the total resistance of the PEDOT without the lithium ions. The maximum resistance depends on different factors such as applied potential and the distribution and concentration of lithium ions inside PEDOT.

\subsection{1-D Memristor Simulation Using a Sinusoid}

The memristor with a pulse train simulation shows the change in resistivity over time due to an applied potential but it does not clearly demnostrate the memory effects. The memory effect of the memristor can be clearly demonstrated in an I-V curve using a sinusoidal potential. Following four graphs (figure \ref{Bowtie}) are created using an AC potential with different frequencies at the contacts. All the plots show that current can have more than one value for the same potential at different times. This means that simulated memristor's past states affects its present output, therefore the device has a memory. There is a pinch in the current for negative applied potential because it is measured from one contact which has relatively low change in resistance for a period of time during transient. 

\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{BowtiefAll}
\caption{Normalized Current vs. applied potential at different frequencies} 
\label{Bowtie}
\end{figure}

The sudden changes in current around 0 V can be attributed to the density limiting mechanism for lithium. Instead of a slowdown in the movement of lithium ions near maximum concentration, the current flow into that region is completely blocked. Even though this makes the lithium density more responsive to changes, sudden movement block combined with large time steps can result in fast changes which can be directly seen as abrupt changes in the hole/lithium current density during transient simulations.  

As AC potential pushes lithium ions from one side to the other, an equilibrium is reached over time. The change in resistivity starts to repeat itself and after a while it becomes  periodic. Figure \ref{BowtieCurr} shows the changes in the memristor current over time for the right metal contact. At first, as lithium moves into the PEDOT there is a drop in the current on average. Once enough lithium settles into the PEDOT:PSS, high resistivity region simply shifts from left to right but it stays fairly constant on average. 

\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{BowtieCurr4f}
\caption{Normalized current over time} 
\label{BowtieCurr}
\end{figure}

Figures \ref{BowtieRes},\ref{Bowhole} and \ref{Bowli} show the changes in the resistivity, hole and lithium density in PEDOT:PSS over time. A visual comparison of the plots show that changes in the lithium density induces changes in the hole density. As the frequency increases diffusion becomes more dominant than drift. At 100 Hz the drift due to the applied potential is barely present. Since the ions do not create a visible impact on the hole density, the resistivity of the device remains constant over time. This means that the memristor model behaves like a regular resistor at high frequencies.

\subsection{1-D Memristor Simulation With Increasing Charge Density}

After establishing that the simulation behaves as expected it is important to investigate how charge density effects this model since the size of the device limits the maximum charge density that can be simulated. The actual device has a hole density in the range of $ \approx 10^{22}$ $m^{-3}$ but the simulation is restricted to $\approx 10^{15}$ $m^{-3}$. In theory, if the densities used for the simulation does have a limited affect on the behavior of the memristor then the simulations with low particle densities can be use as a proxy for the actual device which operates in much higher particle densities.

 Following 3 graphs (\ref{HoleDiff}, \ref{LithiumDiff} and \ref{DensityDiff} ) show the hole and the lithium densities at steady state as well as the current density over time at the right metal contact for various charge densities. The simulations are run using high mesh densities to allow stable simulation at high charge concentrations. 20 different simulations were made using densities ranging from $5$ x $10^{15}$  $m^{-3}$ to 1 x $10^{17}$  $m^{-3}$ but only 5 of them are plotted for illustration purposes. All the values are normalized to the initial plot using respective hole/lithium density ratios. Following equations ares used for the normalization procedure.


\begin{equation}
\centering
n_{norm}= \frac{n_i}{r} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\centering
J_{norm}= \frac{J_i}{r} 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\centering
r = \frac{n_{initial}}{n_{0}}
\label{NormConst}
\end{equation}

$n_{i}$ is the charge carrier density which could be either holes or lithium ions depending on the plot. J is the current density calculated from the right metal contact. r is the normalization constant which is calculated using initial carrier density ($n_{initial}$) of a simulation to be normalized and $n_{0}$ which is the carrier density of the initial plot ($5x10^{15}$ $m^{-3}$). After the normalization of various variables, all the plots are placed in the same graph to visually illustrate how increasing charge density affects the simulation. 

Plots for lithium ions (figure \ref{LithiumDiff}) and holes (figure \ref{HoleDiff}) are nearly identical to each other in terms of the plot shapes. They both get sharper around the area where there is a substantial accumulation of lithium. This is not unexpected since the debye length gets smaller with increasing carrier density. So with increased density it is expected that the density accumulation at the wet/dry PEDOT interface will be more narrow. This affect is not as strong for lithium ions since there is a maximum concentration limit on them. Lithium and hole plots only show the difference carrier density makes at steady state. The affect of debye length on the device operation can be further explored by looking at the current density over time.   

\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.50]{HoleDiff}
\caption{Normalized hole densities at steady state} 
\label{HoleDiff}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.50]{LithiumDiff}
\caption{Normalized lithium densities at steady state} 
\label{LithiumDiff}
\end{figure}

First few miliseconds of this simulation is run without the movement of lithium ions. At this stage normalized currents are identical to each other which means that a simulation with low density can be scaled up to any density without introducing any errors. The introduction of lithium ions slowly deviates the current plots from each other over time but the overall behavior of the memristor remains unchanged. The current density decreases over time and reaches a steady state value. After the first plot which has the lowest hole density, consecutive plots get closer and they are almost impossible to distinguish from each other at steady state.

\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.50]{DensityDiff}
\caption{Normalized hole current densities} 
\label{DensityDiff}
\end{figure}

The impact of increasing charge density can be numerically explored using normalized plots. Following formula is used to calculate a percentage difference between different normalized carrier densities as well as normalized current densities. 


\begin{equation}
\centering
P_i = \frac{1}{ K}\sum_{k=1}^{K}\lvert 100 \;\frac{n_{i}(x_k)/r-n_{0}(x_k)}{n_{0}(x_k)}\rvert
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\centering
P_i = \frac{1}{ T}\sum_{k=1}^{T}\lvert 100 \;\frac{J_{i}(t_k)/r-J_{0}(t_k)}{J_{0}(t)}\rvert
\end{equation}


K is for total number of points along x axis and T is the total number of time steps taken by the simulator. $x_{k}$ and $t_{k}$ are used to for a point in x axis and a point in time respectively. r is the normalization constant described in equation \ref{NormConst}. Both equations start by taking a point in either space (lithium/hole density) or time (current density) for a simulation with a certain carrier density and normalize them. After that point is normalized its difference from the lowest carrier density simulation is calculated as a percentage. Finally all the differences are averaged and used as a measure of the difference between simulations with different charge densities. They can also be used as an approximate error during scaling. 

\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.50]{AllDiff}
\caption{Average difference for hole lithium and current densities for various initial hole densities} 
\label{AllDiff}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{AllDiff} shows the difference hole/lithium density makes in the simulation. Carrier densities in the dry regions of the PEODT:PSS change very little between consecutive simulations since lithium ions do not reach there. For this reason only the densities at the wet PEDOT are used to measure the difference between plots. 

In all 3 cases, there is an increase in average difference for increasing carrier density. Hole density shows the most difference between plots. Since holes are free to move inside the PEDOT:PSS they directly get effected by the change in the debye length due to the increase in hole density. This is not the case for lithium ions because their movement is restricted by the limit on lithium density. In contrast, current density is not as sensitive to density changes as lithium and hole distributions.

 An approximate error estimation can be made for current density if a low hole/lithium density is used for simulation and then scaled up to match the actual memristor. Figure \ref{AllDiff} shows a 3.3 \% difference for 2 orders of magnitude increase in the hole density. Assuming the error scales linearly after that point a total of 6 orders of magnitude will result in 9.9 \% error introduced in order to linearly scale from $10^{15}$ to $10^{21}$. The actual error is likely to be less since the error progresses sub linearly. Following the same procedure 6 orders of magnitude difference produces a 12 \% error for lithium distribution and 48 \% error for hole distribution. The difference in the hole distribution seems very large but the overall shape of the plot is always preserved since most amount change occurs around the wet/dry PEDOT interface where lithium accumulates. Based on these error margins and previous plots it can be concluded that the behavior of the memristor simulated using a low charge density is very similar to the simulation at a high charge density.
